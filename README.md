# CSharp_Abstracting_Shape
## Summary
A learning repo where we explore OOP abstraction principles using c#. Secondary learning goals are to become familiar with c# syntax and Visual Studio IDE workflows.

## Task list
- Create an abstract GeometricShape class
	- Must have a public perimeter and area abstract method that returns a double
- Create a Circle, Square, Triangle, Oval class
	- Implement the abstract methods from the inherited abstract class
	- Add needed fields and constructor parameters to match expected behavior.

## Setup
You will need to have Visual Studio downloaded and installed. Clone the repo and open the solution found in the cloned repo. Then click the green triangle (ctrl + f5. Assuming default layout and keybindings) and it should run the main method on Program.cs.
